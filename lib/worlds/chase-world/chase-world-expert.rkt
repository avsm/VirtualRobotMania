;; Welcome to the chase world!
;; Your goal is to program your robot to hit all the balls as quickly as possible
;; Once you get all the balls, the program will print out how long it took

;; Need a refresher? There are tons of comments here:
;; https://github.com/zevbo/VirtualRobotMania/blob/master/manias/primo-world-example.rkt

;; IMPORTANT REFRESHERS
;; (get-looking-dist angle) -> get's the distance from the center of the robot to the nearest obstacle in the direction of the given angle relative to the robot
;; (set-motors! num1 num2) and (change-motor-inputs num1 num2)

;; NEW STUFF
;; num-balls -> a variable that says the number of balls left
;; (looking-dist-to-ball~ ball#) -> takes a ball# (where ball# is an integer such that: 0 <= ball# < num-balls) and gives you the looking distance to that ball
;;     It will only give you the dist to the ball if the ball changed direction or speed that tick. Otherwise, it will give you false
;; (get-ball-hue ball#) and (get-ball-brightness ball#) -> get's the given ball's hue (color scale) or brightenss
;;     Why are these important? I guess that's the challange....
;; ($get-ball-vy$ ball#) and ($get-ball-vy$ ball#) -> these get the x or y velocity of a given ball. However, if you use them your score doesn't count
;;     You may use them for, let's say, experimental reasons :)

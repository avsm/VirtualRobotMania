### How to start making the robot do stuff!
- Firstly, make sure you know the basics of Racket. This isn't enough room here for a tutorial, but here are a couple of nice ones: https://docs.racket-lang.org/plait/data-tutorial.html, https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/. If you have substantial experience programming, the main 2 things you need to know are that the language is based on the format: (function arguments ...), and to use the amazing racket docs which can be found in Help -> Racket Documentation (on the top)
- At the top of any example mania file, there should be a section called "BASICS" which will have some simple functionality from Racket. There will also be a section called "STUFF TO TRY" which will have functions specific to robot mania. Read through the comments to get a feel of what you can do
- You can write stuff in the body of the "on-tick" function. On-tick is called every tick, and can be thought almost of as the "master function"
- Also you can edit the call to "make-robot" to customize the look (or sometimes functionality) of your robot

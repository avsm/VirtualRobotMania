# Dodgeball World

Welcome to Dodgeball World! This is the first ever Virtual Robotics
1-vs-1 competiton!  Here you will be tasked with creating a robot that
can shoot balls at your opponent, better than your opponent can shoot
them at you.

Every time you get hit your robot will fade away just a bit.  The last
robot standing wins.

## Rules

As long as you aren't in your cooldown period (mode on that later) and
you have at least one ball left, you can shoot from the front of your
robot with the (shoot) function.

When you fire a ball it will come out as your color (red or green
depending on where you start). If you get hit by a ball of the other
players color, you will lose a life and become more transparent.

Every tick, there is some chance (depending on your level) that a ball
you just fired will become neutral, and turn black

If you hit a black (or neutral ball) and you have fewer balls than
your ball capacity, you will pick up that ball.

You are hit by a ball if the bounding box of your robot intersects the
bounding box of the ball. Note: if the ball is completely inside of
your robot, you can neither pick it up nor be hit by it, until it hits
the edge.

Remember how whenever you get hit you lose a life and become more
transparent? Well, when you become fully transparent, that means you
have no more lives left and the other robot wins

Last note: you will start either in the bottom left or top right
(there is a little randomness in the starting y position)

## Past functions

- `(set-motors! n1 n2)` sets the force being put into each side of the
  robot. 1 is the max, and -1 is the min for each side
- `(change-motor-inputs n1 n2)` changes the force being put into each
  of the robot by the give amount for example: if before the motors
  were set to `(0.6, 0.3)`, and you call `(change-motor-inputs -0.1
  0.4)`, the motors will become set to `(0.5, 0.7)`

- `(get-looking-dist angle)` sees how far you can look in the
  direction of the given angle until there is an object, ; which could
  be a ball, wall or another robot. It is measured from the center of
  the robot, 0 is looking directly ; forward, and positive angles are
  towards the left.

- `(get-lookahead-dist)` and `(get-lookbehind-dist)` are the same as
  get-looking-dist except they are measured ; from the front and back
  of the robot respectively, and obviously the angles are always 0 and
  180 degrees respectively

- `(get-left%)`, `(get-right%)` gets the input (ie: force) to the left
  or right motors

- `(get-robot-angle)` get's the global angle (ie what angle the robot
  is drawn at) of the robot. Again, turning leftwards is positive. The
  robot starts at an angle of 0.  The magnitude of this angle can be
  larger than 180. For instance, if you make one rull rotation,
  `(get-robot-angle)` will return 360

- `(normalize-angle angle)` takes an angle outside of the range [-180,
  180) and returns the coresponding angle in that range

- `(get-vl)`, `(get-vr)` get's the speed (in pixels per tick) of the
  left and right wheel of your robot

## New functions

Note that any specs that depend on your level can be found by runnning
`(level-diffs)`.


- `(shoot)` shoots a ball forward. The speed is effected by the speed of your robot

- `(angles-to-neutral-balls)` returns a list of the angles to all the
  neutral balls (neutral balls = balls you can pick up) if a ball is
  straight ahead, it will say 0.

- `(get-cooldown-time)` returns how many ticks until you can shoot
  again. 0 if you can shoot now. run `(level-diffs)` to see average
  cooldown periods.

- `(num-balls-left)` returns the number of balls you have left
- `(front-left-close?)`, `(front-right-close?)`, `(back-left-close?)`,
  `(back-right-close?)` tells you if any given corner is very close
  (within 15) of a wall

- `(angle-to-other-bot)` returns the angle to the other bot. Leftwards
  is positive. If you are facing the other robot, this function will
  return 0. If it is directly behind you, it will return -180. If you
  would have to turn a little left to be facing it the number would be
  a small positive. Another way to think about what this function
  does, is say how much left you have to turn to be facing the other
  bot.

- `(relative-angle-of-other-bot)` tells you the relative angle of the
  other robot. So, if they are coming directly twoards you, it is 180
  or -180. Precisely, it is their angle - your angle.

- `(dist-to-other-bot)` returns the distance in pixels to the other
  robot

- `(other-bot-shooting?)` tells you if the other bot shot last tick

- `(other-bot-level)` returns the level of the other robot. Possible
  values are: `'normal`, `'advanced` and `'expert`

- `(set-degree-mode)`, `(set-radian-mode)` makes it so that all of
  your angles (both that you give to get from functions) are in the
  mode that you choose. Make sure to write this in on-tick. a quick
  referesher: in degrees angle go from 0 to 360. Radians go from 0 to
  2Ï€
